                <h3>Hacking and Development</h3>
                <p>Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad discipline, 
                    which covers a wide range of topics. The first known event of 
                    hacking had taken place in 1960 at MIT and at the same time, the term "Hacker" was originated.
                    Hacking is the act of finding the possible entry points that exist in a computer system or a 
                    computer network and finally entering into them. Hacking is usually done to gain unauthorized 
                    access to a computer system or a computer network, either to harm the systems or to steal sensitive 
                    information available on the computer. Hacking is usually legal as long as it is being done to find 
                    weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose. This sort of hacking is what we call
                     Ethical Hacking.A computer expert who does the act of hacking is called a "Hacker". Hackers are those who seek knowledge, 
                    to understand how systems operate, how they are designed, and then attempt to play with these systems. </p>

                <h3>Skills of certified ethical hacker certification</h3>
                <p>In Programming and hacking community, a Script Kiddie is an unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by 
                    others to attack computers or any network. Kiddie is not related to an individualâ€™s age but the lack of knowledge and experience in the hacking industry.
                    A Disgruntled Employee performing cyber-attack is a common example of Script-Kiddie If you have the real skills or want to learn to hack than one of the
